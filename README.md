## My Role

**Geospatial Data Engineer Intern**
Durham Public Schools, Durham, NC
*May 2023 – Aug 2023*

During my internship, I applied geospatial analysis techniques using ArcGIS and Python’s ArcPy to study student population distribution and forecast growth, aiding in the transition of spatial data from older systems to ArcGIS Enterprise. I automated repetitive data extraction and update tasks by scripting in R, utilizing packages like ggplot2, dplyr, sf, jsonlite, and httr to efficiently manage parcel and census datasets tied to statewide mapping initiatives, which reduced manual labor by several hours weekly. Additionally, I developed interactive data visualizations and dashboards in Power BI to communicate insights to district planners and leadership, supporting strategic decision-making. 📊🌍
